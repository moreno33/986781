    <h1>JavaScript Scope Exercise</h1>
    <dl>
        <dt>
            1. Determine what this Javascript code will print out (without running it):<br/>
            x = 1;<br/>
            var a = 5;<br/>
            var b = 10;
            var c = function(a, b, c) {<br/>
            var x = 10;<br/>
            document.write(x);<br/>
            document.write(a);<br/>
            var f = function(a, b, c) {<br/>
            b = a;<br/>
            document.write(b);<br/>
            b = c;<br/>
            var x = 5;<br/>
            }<br/>
            f(a,b,c);<br/>
            document.write(b);<br/>
            }<br/>
            c(8,9,10);<br/>
            document.write(b);<br/>
            document.write(x);<br/>
            }
        </dt>
        <dd>This code will print out: <strong>10889101</strong></dd>
        <dt>2. What is the difference between a method and function?</dt>
        <dd>
            A <strong>function</strong> is a piece of code that can be called directly
            on the global scope (window) and run a defined algorithm<br/>
            Ex: function myFunction(){<br/>
                //statements;<br/>
            }<br/>
            To call it we can do this:<br/>
            myFunction();<br/>
            or<br/>
            window.myFunction();<br/>
            In the meanwhile a method is almost the same thing as a function with the
            difference that a method is defined inside of a user defined object and
            should be called on this object.<br/>
            Ex:var myObjectPrototype= {<br/>
                a:function myFunction(){<br/>
                }<br/>
            }<br/>
            var myObject= Object.create(myObjectPrototype);<br/>
            myObject.myFunction();

        </dd>
        <dt>3. What does 'this' refer to when used in a Java method?</dt>
        <dd>It means the actual object on which we are working.</dd>
        <dt>4. What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript method?</dt>
        <dd>
            When called in JavaScript method, 'this' refers to any derived object
            on which the method is called.
        </dd>
        <dt>5. What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript constructor function?</dt>
        <dd>
            When used in JavaScript constructor function, 'this' refers to every object that
            is going to be constructed from this constructor.
        </dd>
        <dt> 6. Assume object x is the prototype for object y in Javascript. Object x has a method f( ) containing keyword 'this'.
            When f is called by x.f( ), what does 'this' refer to?</dt>
        <dd>
            "This" refers to the object on which the function is called in this case it refers to x.
        </dd>

        <dt>7. What is a free variable in JavaScript?</dt>
        <dd>
            It's a variable referred to by a function that is not one of its parameter or local variable.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            8. Create an object that has properties with name = "fred" and major="music" and a property that is a function
            that takes 2 numbers and returns the smallest of the two, or the square of the two if they are equal.
        </dt>
        <dd>
            var object={<br/>
            name: "fred",<br/>
            major: "music",<br/>
            smallestOrSquare: function (val1, val2) {<br/>
            if(val1== val2){<br/>
            return Math.sqrt(val1+val2);<br/>
            }else{<br/>
            return Math.min(val1, val2);<br/>
            }<br/>
            }<br/>
            }<br/>
        </dd>
        <dt>9. Write Javascript code for creating three Employee objects using the "new" keyword and a constructor function.
            Employee objects have the following fields: name, salary, position.</dt>
        <dd>
            function Employee(name, salary, position) {<br/>
            this.name= name;<br/>
            this.salary= salary;<br/>
            this.position= position;<br/>
            }<br/>

            var employee1= new Employee("Mary", 30000, "Secretary");<br/>
            var employee2= new Employee("Moreno", 100000, "Developer");<br/>
            var employee3= new Employee("Merloo", 70000, "Nurse");<br/>

        </dd>
        <dt>10. Write a Javascript function that takes any number of input arguments and returns the product of the
            arguments.</dt>
        <dd>
            function f(...args) {<br/>
            return args.reduce((total, currentValue, currentIndex, array)=>total+=currentValue);<br/>
            }<br/>
            f(1, 2, 3, 4);<br/>
        </dd>
        <dt>11. Write an arrow function that returns the maximum of its three input arguments.</dt>
        <dd>var max= (a, b, c)=> Math.max(a, b, c);</dd>
