    <h2>Quiz</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>1. What is the difference between a web server and a web container?</dt>
        <dd>
            The web server is the application that allows the sent and receipt of message
            with the client trough a request/response protocol HTTP. The Web server can
            generate only static messages.
            Whereas a web container is a group of objects that allows the treatment of
            messages dynamically. It allows to return dynamic response according to the
            user input.
        </dd>
        <dt>2. What is a servlet?</dt>
        <dd>
            A servlet is a java class that extends the capability of servers that host
            applications access by means of request-response programming model.<br/>
            We can also say that a servlet is a server-side java code that can handle
            http requests and return dynamic content.
        </dd>
        <dt>3. How do web servers and web containers interact with servlets?</dt>
        <dd>
            When the client sends a request, the server handles the request to the web container and
            the web container is the one that needs to search in the list of its servlets if there is
            one that its url-pattern corresponds to the url request. If it finds one, it leaves to this
            servlet the responsibility of process the request, if it doesn't find anyone it throws a
            404 error.
        </dd>
        <dt>4. Who creates request objects?</dt>
        <dd>
            The client is the one that creates the request object.
        </dd>
        <dt>5. What are the states in the servlet lifecycle?</dt>
        <dd>
            <ul>
                <li>Loading- Class c= Class.forName(...);</li>
                <li>Intantiation- c.newInstance();</li>
                <li>Initiation-init();</li>
                <li>Implementation-service();</li>
                <li>Destruction-destroy</li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>6. Who calls init and when?</dt>
        <dd>
            The web container is the one that calls init and it calls it right after the instantiation.
            And this method is called only once during the lifetime of the servlet.
        </dd>
        <dt>7. Which of init, service, and doGet should you override?</dt>
        <dd>
            doGet is the one that should be overridden most of the time.<br/>
            (But sometimes we can override init in case we want to instantiate  an object only once
            in the servlet, for example a database connection.)
        </dd>
        <dt>8. In what sense are servlets multi-threaded?</dt>
        <dd>
            Servlets are multi-threaded in the sense that
            their service() method may be called many times and for
            that they need to be multi-threaded to handle all the
            requests more smoothly.
        </dd>
        <dt>9. What are the implications of this for servlet instance variables?</dt>
        <dd>
            The implication is that servlet instance variables are not thread-safe
            and we need to be careful when we are creating instance variable. For instance,
            it's not a good practice to have request or session scope as an instance
            variable in a servlet.
        </dd>
