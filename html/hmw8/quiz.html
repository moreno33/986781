    <dl>
        <dt>1. Can post requests be bookmarked? What are the problems?</dt>
        <dd>
            No, a post request can't be bookmarked. Trying to do so will result in a get request.
            The problem is just because a post request is not idempotent. Because, normally when
            you bookmarked a request, you do that in the objective to retrieve the same thing later,
            but it can't be like that for a post request because it's not idempotent.
        </dd>
        <dt>2. What is the purpose of request dispatching?</dt>
        <dd>
            The purpose of request dispatching is to allow interaction between servlet and
            JSP.
        </dd>
        <dt>3. What is the difference between redirect and request dispatch?</dt>
        <dd>
            A request dispatch is operated only to the side of the server and also you can dispatch a request only to
            a resource that is on the same server.<br/>
            Whereas a redirect is doing to the client side and you can redirect even to a resource
            that is not on the same server.
        </dd>
        <dt>4. What is an attribute ?</dt>
        <dd>
            An attribute is a variable that you can save in one of the scope of an application. When I say scope,
            I mean Page, Request, Session, Application. To save the attribute you call the <strong>setAttribute()</strong> method
            and to retrieve you call the <strong>getAttribute()</strong> method
        </dd>
        <dt>5. What is the difference between attributes and parameters?</dt>
        <dd>
            There are 2 main differences between attributes and parameters:<br/>
            There first one is: only the scope Request can contain parameter. Whereas an attribute
            can be saved in the Page, Request, Session or Application scope.<br/>
            The second one is: an attribute is passed by the user using the <strong>setAttribute()</strong>
            method whereas the parameter is taken from the url or the request body and
            saved automatically by the web container in the request object.
        </dd>
        <dt>6. What are dangers of using attributes?</dt>
        <dd>
            The dangers of using attributes are to know in which scope to save them. For example, if you save a
            confidential attribute in the application scope, it will exist during the lifetime of the application
            and it will be visible to all the users.
        </dd>
        <dt>7. What does it mean to say that http is stateless? Give an example of a stateful protocol.</dt>
        <dd>
            Saying that http is a stateless protocol means it doesn't keep anything and doens't have any idea
            about its previous state. It execute only once and after that it looses all information about itself.
        </dd>
        <dt>8. Give 5 different methods for maintaining state information (count each attribute scope as one
            method).</dt>
        <dt>9. How long does a session last?</dt>
        <dd>
            It depends. If the application is active that means a person is using it, the session will last until
            the application is closed. But, in case of some web container like tomcat, if the applications stays
            inactive for 30mn, the session will be destroy automatically.
        </dd>
        <dt>10. What is a cookie, and how long does a cookie last?</dt>
        <dd>
            A cookie is a small file saved in the browser and it lifetime depends on what
            we have precised for it. We can fix a long or short lifetime for a cookie.
        </dd>
        <dt>11. What is the purpose of URL rewriting?</dt>
        <dd>The purpose of URL rewriting is to allow the creation of beautiful and meaningful URL</dd>
        <dt>12. Why does the request attribute report ‘null’ for the maintaining state demo?</dt>
        <dd></dd>
